### Sign your work

We use the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) as a additional safeguard
for the HackMD project. This is a well established and widely used
mechanism to assure contributors have confirmed their right to license
their contribution under the project's license.
Please read [contribute/developer-certificate-of-origin][dcofile].
If you can certify it, then just add a line to every git commit message:

````
  Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>
````

Use your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions).
If you set your `user.name` and `user.email` git configs, you can sign your
commit automatically with `git commit -s`. You can also use git [aliases](https://git-scm.com/book/tr/v2/Git-Basics-Git-Aliases)
like `git config --global alias.ci 'commit -s'`. Now you can commit with
`git ci` and the commit will be signed.
