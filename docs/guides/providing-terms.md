Setup your terms of use
===

To setup your terms of use, you need to provide a document called `terms-of-use.md` which contains them. Of course written in Markdown.

It has to be provided under `./public/docs/` and will be automatically turned into a HackMD document. It will also automatically updated as soon as you change the document on disk.

As soon as the file exists a link will show up in the bottom part along with the release notes and link to them.

Setup your privacy policy
===

To add a privacy policy you can use the same technique as for the terms of use. The main difference is that the document is called `privacy.md`.

See our example file `./public/docs/privacy.md.example` container some useful hints for writing your own privacy policy.

As with the terms of use, a link to the privacy notices will show up in the area where the release notes are provided on the index page.
