These services are, depending on your login method, the document you visit and the setup of this instance: Google, Disqus, MathJax, GitHub, SlideShare/LinkedIn, yahoo, Gravatar, Imgur, Amazon, and Cloudflare.|
|Usernames and profiles|Your username as well as user profiles that are connected with it are transmitted and stored by us to provide a useful login integration with services like GitHub, Facebook, Twitter, GitLab, Dropbox, Google.

|Uploaded pictures| Pictures that are uploaded for documents are either uploaded to Amazon S3, Imgur, a minio instance or the local filesystem of the CodiMD server.|

All account data and notes are stored in a mysql/postgres/sqlite database. Besides the user accounts and the document themselves also relationships between the documents and the user accounts are stored. This includes ownership, authorship and revisions of all changes made during the creation of a note.

To delete your account and all your notes owned by your user account, you can find a button in the drop down menu on the front page.

The deletion of guest notes is not possible. These don't have any ownership and this means we can't connect these to you or anyone else. If you participated in a guest note or a note owned by someone else, your authorship for the revisions is removed from these notes as well. But the content you created will stay in place as the integrity of these notes has to stay untouched.
