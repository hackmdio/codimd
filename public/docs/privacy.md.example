All account data and notes are stored in a mysql/postgres/sqlite database. Besides the user accounts and the document themselves also relationships between the documents and the user accounts are stored. This includes ownership, authorship and revisions of all changes made during the creation of a note.

To delete your account and all your notes owned by your user account, you can find a button in the drop down menu on the front page.

The deletion of guest notes is not possible. These don't have any ownership and this means we can't connect these to you or anyone else. If you participated in a guest note or a note owned by someone else, your authorship for the revisions is removed from these notes as well. But the content you created will stay in place as the integrity of these notes has to stay untouched.
