First you need to insert syntax like this at the **start** of the note:
```
---
YAML metas
---
```

Replace the "YAML metas" in this section with any YAML options as below.
You can also refer to this note's source code.

title
---
This option will set the note title which prior than content title.

> default: not set

**Example**
```yml
title: meta title
```

description
---
This option will set the note description.

> default: not set

**Example**
```yml
description: meta description
```

tags
---
This option will set the tags which prior than content tags.

> default: not set

**Example**
```yml
tags: features, cool, updated
```

robots
---
This option will give below meta in the note head meta:
```xml
<meta name="robots" content="your_meta">
```
So you can prevent any search engine index your note by set `noindex, nofollow`.

> default: not set

**Example**
```yml
robots: noindex, nofollow
```

lang
---
This option will set the language of the note, that might alter some typography of it.
You can find your the language code in ISO 639-1 standard:

The original markdown syntax breaks only if you put space twice, but HackMD choose to breaks every time you enter a break.
