In this release, we've added some Markdown renderer plugins, including fretboard guitar, Mindmap, and CSV. We believe the simplicity and the extensibility of markdown can bring more possibilities to you and your workflow. So let's find out more about what we can do with markdown. :100: 

We also fixed a long-lasting issue: CodiMD cannot be hosted under URL subpath perfectly. Check PR [#1551](https://github.com/hackmdio/codimd/pull/1551) for details.

Last but not least, we start standarizing CodiMD API. We drafted [`List my notes`](https://github.com/hackmdio/codimd/pull/1548) API in this release. Stay tuned. :person_in_lotus_position: 

Here are some highlights from this release:

- [Fretboard Guitar tab renderer](#Fretboard-Guitar-tab-renderer)
- [Mindmap rendrer](#Mindmap)
- [Image Lightbox](#Image-Lightbox-Support)
- [CSV renderer](#Render-csv-codeblock-as-table)
